# DXCam mouse following

This "alt" version uses a different method of utilizing DXCam to capture screen, and the capture region will always follow the cursor even if it isn't centered on the screen. However:
-performance are significantly worse
-CPS is limited by your game FPS
-This one is based off the AMD version, I dont have a nvidia GPU
